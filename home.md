## About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Interdepartmental Nutrition Program at Purdue University. My research focuses on the **drivers of caregiving behaviors** and interventions to improve child nutrition and development in low-resource settings. I work under the mentorship of Prof. [Nilupa S Gunaratna](https://hhs.purdue.edu/directory/nilupa-gunaratna/).

Prior to Purdue, I served as an [Assistant Professor](https://www.nstu.edu.bd/faculty-member.php?faculty=susmita-ghosh-ega249) _(currently on sabbatical)_ at Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU) in Bangladesh.
