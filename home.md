## About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Interdepartmental Nutrition Program at Purdue University. My research focuses on the **drivers of caregiving behaviors** and interventions to improve child nutrition and development in low-resource settings. I work under the mentorship of Dr. [Nilupa S Gunaratna](https://hhs.purdue.edu/directory/nilupa-gunaratna/).

Prior to Purdue, I served as an Assistant Professor (currently on sabbatical) at Noakhali Science and Technology University in Bangladesh.
